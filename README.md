# React NYC Demo Code

This is based on the boilerplate template from [here](https://github.com/jpsierens/webpack-react-redux). Sorry for some of the leftover sloppiness, there's more in this boilerplate than we really need for the demo.

Hopefully you can follow along during the talk or use this as a referance afterward.
